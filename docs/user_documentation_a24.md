### Hosting Requirements

To host this website, you need:
- Web hosting service with HTML/CSS/JavaScript support
- No server-side language requirements (PHP, Python, etc.) for the basic functionality
- For advanced features (contact form submission, database storage), additional server-side setup would be required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Admin login doesn't work
**Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct username and password. If you've forgotten your password, you'll need to access your hosting server and edit the admin credentials file directly.

**Issue**: Images don't appear after uploading
**Solution**: Check that the images are in the correct format (JPG, PNG) and not too large in file size. Recommended maximum file size is 2MB per image.

**Issue**: Website appears broken on mobile devices
**Solution**: Clear your browser cache or try viewing in a different browser. The website is designed to be responsive, but some caching issues can occur.

**Issue**: Contact form doesn't send messages
**Solution**: The contact form in this demo version stores messages locally. For a fully functional contact form, you'll need to implement server-side processing.
